//! Term interning: the in-memory faulting dictionary mapping a gram to a permanent
//! `u32` term-id, plus the per-script-class document-frequency statistics that traffic
//! with it.
//!
//! Postings (`post`/`delta`/`term`-df/`fwd`) are keyed by the `u32` id, not the gram —
//! narrow integer B-trees, fast point seeks, a smaller index. The gram's encoding (its
//! [`Term`](crate::Term) `u128`, stored 16-byte big-endian) lives only in the
//! `dict` table. Ids are **monotonic and permanent**: a gram keeps its id until a
//! [`rebuild`](crate::Index::rebuild) reassigns the whole space (bumping the generation).
//!
//! **Reader/writer fault split (a correctness contract the types enforce):**
//! - A reader calls [`Dictionary::resolve`] — a read that returns `None` on a miss (the
//!   gram is absent, an empty posting). It never mutates, allocates, or writes.
//! - A writer takes an [`InternStage`] (only reachable on a write path, which holds the
//!   single-writer lease) and calls [`InternStage::intern_term`], which allocates an id and
//!   persists a `dict` row inside the write transaction. Staged grams enter the shared
//!   in-memory map only via [`InternStage::commit`], called **after** the transaction
//!   commits — so a rolled-back write leaves no orphan id.
//!
//! The dictionary also owns the per-class [`ClassStats`] (recomputed from the df column
//! on open/rebuild, maintained incrementally via [`Dictionary::apply_df_changes`]) and
//! the id→class table both need.
